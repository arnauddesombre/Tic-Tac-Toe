# TicTacToe
Game of Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe developed in Python (2 or 3).
Tkinter is used for graphics (required) and Pyglet for sound (not required, game has a silent mode). Tkinter  is included with all standard Python distributions, Pyglet can be installed using:

    pip install pyglet

The Artificial Intelligence uses a min-max algorithm; the depth of the tree increases with the game level. Within the game, press the number keys (0 to 9) to change the game level (however, it will be impossible to win past level 3 or 4), and the letter S to toggle the sound from mute to on.
