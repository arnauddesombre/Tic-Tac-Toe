# TicTacToe
Game of Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe developed in Python (2 or 3).
Tkinter is used for graphics (required) and Pyglet for sound (not required, game has a silent mode).

The Artificial Intelligence uses a min-max algorithm; the depth of the tree increases with the game level. Press the number keys (0 to 9) to change the game level (it will be impossible to win past level 3 or 4), and the letter S to toggle the sound from mute to on.
